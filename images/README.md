# Images Folder

Place your photos here! The website is set up to display 6 photos in a grid.

## Instructions:

1. Add your photos to this folder
2. Name them: `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`, `photo3.jpg`, etc.
3. You can use JPG, PNG, or any other image format
4. For best results, use square photos or photos with similar aspect ratios

If you want to use different filenames, just update the image sources in the `index.html` file.
