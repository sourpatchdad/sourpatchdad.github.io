            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>I'm a Senior Data Analyst based in Denton, Texas, specializing in turning complex data into actionable business insights. With expertise in Excel and Power BI, I develop integrated solutions that streamline compliance and regulatory processes through web and field form automation.</p>

                <p>My background in financial analysis gives me a unique perspective on P&L management, budgeting, job costing, and process automation. I'm passionate about building systems that not only solve immediate problems but also scale with business needs.</p>

                <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
                <p>Throughout my career, I've focused on bridging the gap between technical capabilities and business requirements. I specialize in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Business Intelligence & Data Visualization (Power BI, Excel)</li>
                    <li>Process Automation & Integration</li>
                    <li>Financial Analysis & Reporting</li>
                    <li>Regulatory Compliance Solutions</li>
                    <li>Database Design & Management</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
                <p>When I'm not analyzing data, I'm deeply invested in several hobbies and activities:</p>

                <p><strong>Media Enthusiast:</strong> I meticulously track every movie and show I watch on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/sourpatchdad/">Letterboxd</a> and <a href="https://trakt.tv/users/sourpatchdad">Trakt</a>. I've even automated this tracking to display on my website using GitHub Actions and APIs.</p>

                <p><strong>Home Automation & Tech Projects:</strong> I enjoy building practical solutions with Home Assistant, Raspberry Pi, and other technologies. My projects range from comprehensive home automation systems to Bitcoin mining experiments with BitAxe hardware.</p>

                <p><strong>Faith & Community:</strong> My wife and I have been active members of our church since 2010. I serve on the production team handling technical aspects of services, and together we lead marriage groups, helping couples build stronger relationships.</p>

                <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                <p>I believe in the power of small, iterative improvements. Whether it's optimizing a business process, automating a repetitive task, or fine-tuning a home automation routine, I'm always looking for ways to make systems work smarter, not harder.</p>

                <p>My approach combines technical rigor with practical pragmatism—building solutions that are both elegant and maintainable.</p>
